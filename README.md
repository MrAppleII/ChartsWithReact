# ChartsWithReact

# Proper Usage 

First import just the main file using a line that looks like this 

```
import GraphGen from '../../Graphs/GraphGen'

```
Then define what kind of chart you need. The only prop you realy need to pass in is the data which must contain "values" and "labels".
```
var ourData = {
      labels: ["Jan", "Feb", "March", "May", "Jun", "July","Aug"],
      values: [25, 23, 27, 5, 5, 5, 10],
    }
```

Here is an example of creating a Pie Chart. We only need to pass in the data and the size which must be a number. 

```
 < GraphGen 
         size={300}
         chartType="pie"
        chartData = {ourData} style={{marginTop:"20px",}}  />
```
Here is an example of calling a bar graph. If a minimum or maximum y scale is not included, one will be autogenerated for you from the data provided. It may not always provide pleasing results however. Also, the titles are optional. Notice however we use "height" and "width" instead of size.

```
< GraphGen 
         xAxisTitle="Month"
         yAxisTitle="Payments"
         maxYScale={40}
         minYScale={0}
        height={400}
        width={400}
         chartType="bar"
        chartData = {ourData} style={{marginTop:"20px",}}  />
```

Here is you create a line graph. The same rules apply regarding the autogenerated scale and the titles being optional. The style prop is optional too. 
```
 < GraphGen 
         xAxisTitle="Month"
         yAxisTitle="Payments"
         maxYScale={40}
         minYScale={0}
        height={400}
        width={400}
         chartType="line"
        chartData = {ourData} style={{marginTop:"20px",}}  />


```

# Handling multiple data arrays
If you select line graph to display, you can pass in multiple arrays in the fashion 

{
    labels:["my Labels","Here is another"],
    values: [[25, 10, 30, 2.50,2.50,30],[4,32,78,20,60,32]]

}

# Setting the colors for Line and Pie Charts.

```
    var colors = ["#32a852","#9da19e","#267eb5","#FFB6C1","#f2bc27","#ff0fb7"]
< GraphGen 
         xAxisTitle="Month"
         yAxisTitle="Payments"
         graphColors = {colors}
        size={205}
        fadeIn={true}
         chartType="pie"
        chartData = {ourData} style={{marginTop:"20px",marginBottom:"30px"}}  />

```

# Fade in prop

If this is set to true, the chart will fade into view after loading.
